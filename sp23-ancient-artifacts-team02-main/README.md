## Research Idea 

The goal of our project is to create a supervised machine learning model that automatically classifies particles as soil or lithic microdebitage using the information from measurements of particles made by the PartAn3D particle analyzer. 

Accomplishing this goal would save researchers countless hours they would otherwise spend manually classifying these particles using a microscope. 


## Data 

We have ~103,000 data points of soil data from a soil sample and ~5,000 data points of experimental lithic microdebitage data from the debris generated from a modern stone knapper who creates stone tools through traditional materials and techniques.
